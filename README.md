Ultimate JS Rotate
======

A tool for CSS rotations using JavaScript.
It can rotate any HTML Element, even in Internet Explorer. Say goodbye to the crappy Canvas and Flash workarounds or the 4 position bullshit of IE. Finally, the right and simplest solution.

Not matters if it's an image, a div, a text or whatever, just let it roll!...
