At last... A CSS Rotate without bullshit
======

KaisarCode Rotate is a JavaScript tool for CSS rotations using JavaScript (yes, not freakin' JQuery).
It can rotate any HTML Element, even in Internet Explorer. Say goodbye to the crappy Canvas and Flash workarounds or the 4 position lie of IE. Finally, the right and simplest solution.

Not matters if it's an image, a div, a text or whatever, just let it roll!...
